# Digitos
Team members: Emma Morgan, Sean Roelofs, Ana Sofia Nicholls
Description:
Digitos is a three part project that includes a robotic hand, sensor glove, and graphics display. A user can wear the glove and move their fingers. The display will then show where the pi thinks the fingers are. Finally the robotic hand will mimic the display with servo actuated joints.  
Hardware required: 7 short flex sensors, 14 servos, pwm multiplexor
Funds requested: $50, can e-mail receipts.
Task breakdown:
Building sensory glove - Sean
Building robotic hand - Emma
Graphics display - Ana
Goals for next week:
Emma: have all the mechanics working and be able to control servos from chip.
Sean: have the sensor glove built and be able to communicate with one of the sensors.
Ana: be able to display a hand on the screen.
